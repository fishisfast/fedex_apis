# FedexApis

Ruby wrapper for Fedex RESTful APIs.

## Installation

Add  to your Gemfile:

    gem 'fedex_apis', git: 'github.com/fishisfast/fedex_apis'


## Usage

### Setup

Initialize the client with your FedEx API credentials:

```ruby
require 'fedex_apis'

# Option 1: Use environment variables from .env file
# Create a .env file with:
#   FEDEX_APIS_HOST=https://apis-sandbox.fedex.com
#   FEDEX_APIS_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
#   FEDEX_APIS_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
#   FEDEX_APIS_ACCOUNT_NUMBER=your_account_number
require 'dotenv/load'
client = FedexApis::Client.new

# Option 2: Use environment variables (without .env file)
# Set FEDEX_APIS_HOST, FEDEX_APIS_CLIENT_ID, FEDEX_APIS_CLIENT_SECRET, FEDEX_APIS_ACCOUNT_NUMBER
client = FedexApis::Client.new

# Option 3: Pass credentials directly
client = FedexApis::Client.new(
  host: 'https://apis-sandbox.fedex.com',
  client_id: 'your_client_id',
  client_secret: 'your_client_secret',
  account_number: 'your_account_number'
)
```

### Rate API

Get shipping rates for a shipment:

```ruby
rate_params = {
  requestedShipment: {
    shipper: {
      address: {
        postalCode: 19726,
        countryCode: "US"
      }
    },
    recipient: {
      address: {
        postalCode: 2116,
        countryCode: "AU"
      }
    },
    shipDateStamp: "2024-01-15",
    pickupType: "DROPOFF_AT_FEDEX_LOCATION",
    serviceType: "INTERNATIONAL_PRIORITY",
    rateRequestType: ["LIST", "ACCOUNT"],
    requestedPackageLineItems: [
      {
        weight: {
          units: "KG",
          value: 10
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}

rate = client.rate(rate_params)

if rate.success?
  quotes = rate.output['rateReplyDetails']
  quotes.each do |quote|
    puts "Service: #{quote['serviceType']}"
    puts "Total: #{quote['ratedShipmentDetails'][0]['totalNetCharge']}"
  end
end
```

### Tracking API

Track a shipment by tracking number:

```ruby
tracking_params = {
  trackingInfo: [
    {
      trackingNumberInfo: {
        trackingNumber: "794972072690"
      }
    }
  ],
  includeDetailedScans: true
}

tracking = client.track(tracking_params)

if tracking.success?
  results = tracking.output['completeTrackResults']
  results.each do |result|
    track_result = result['trackResults'][0]
    puts "Status: #{track_result['latestStatusDetail']['description']}"
    puts "Delivery Date: #{track_result['dateAndTimes'][0]['dateTime']}"
  end
end
```

### Shipment API

#### Create a Shipment

Create a single package shipment and get the label:

```ruby
shipment_params = {
  labelResponseOptions: "LABEL",
  requestedShipment: {
    shipper: {
      contact: {
        personName: "John Sender",
        phoneNumber: "1234567890",
        companyName: "Sender Company"
      },
      address: {
        streetLines: ["123 Sender St"],
        city: "Austin",
        stateOrProvinceCode: "TX",
        postalCode: "73301",
        countryCode: "US"
      }
    },
    recipients: [
      {
        contact: {
          personName: "Jane Recipient",
          phoneNumber: "9876543210",
          companyName: "Recipient Company"
        },
        address: {
          streetLines: ["456 Recipient Ave"],
          city: "Los Angeles",
          stateOrProvinceCode: "CA",
          postalCode: "90001",
          countryCode: "US"
        }
      }
    ],
    shipDatestamp: "2024-01-15",
    serviceType: "FEDEX_GROUND",
    packagingType: "YOUR_PACKAGING",
    pickupType: "USE_SCHEDULED_PICKUP",
    shippingChargesPayment: {
      paymentType: "SENDER"
    },
    labelSpecification: {
      imageType: "PDF",
      labelStockType: "PAPER_85X11_TOP_HALF_LABEL"
    },
    requestedPackageLineItems: [
      {
        weight: {
          units: "LB",
          value: 10
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}

shipment = client.create_shipment(shipment_params)

if shipment.success?
  # Get tracking number
  puts "Tracking Number: #{shipment.tracking_number}"
  
  # ⭐ Consistent Interface - Get label content (works with both URL and base64)
  shipment.save_label('label.pdf')  # Simplest - saves directly to file
  
  # Or get the binary content
  label_binary = shipment.label_content
  File.write('label.pdf', label_binary, mode: 'wb')
  
  # Get all documents
  shipment.documents.each do |doc|
    puts "Document: #{doc['contentType']} - #{doc['docType']}"
  end
end
```

#### Multi-Package Shipment (MPS)

Create a shipment with multiple packages:

```ruby
shipment_params = {
  labelResponseOptions: "LABEL",
  requestedShipment: {
    # ... shipper and recipient details ...
    requestedPackageLineItems: [
      { weight: { units: "LB", value: 10 } },
      { weight: { units: "LB", value: 15 } },
      { weight: { units: "LB", value: 8 } }
    ]
  }
}

shipment = client.create_shipment(shipment_params)

if shipment.success?
  # Master tracking number for the entire shipment
  puts "Master Tracking: #{shipment.master_tracking_number}"
  
  # Individual tracking numbers for each package
  shipment.tracking_numbers.each_with_index do |tn, i|
    puts "Package #{i + 1}: #{tn}"
  end
  
  # ⭐ Consistent Interface - Save all labels (works with both URL and base64)
  saved_files = shipment.save_labels('./labels')
  saved_files.each { |file| puts "Saved: #{file}" }
  
  # Or get all label contents as binary data
  shipment.label_contents.each_with_index do |content, i|
    puts "Label #{i + 1}: #{content.bytesize} bytes"
  end
end
```

#### Validate a Shipment

Validate shipment details before creating:

```ruby
validation = client.validate_shipment(shipment_params)

if validation.success?
  puts "Shipment is valid!"
else
  puts "Validation errors:"
  validation.errors.each { |e| puts e['message'] }
end
```

#### Cancel a Shipment

Cancel a shipment using its tracking number:

```ruby
cancel = client.cancel_shipment("794972072690")

if cancel.success?
  puts "Shipment cancelled successfully"
end
```

### Working with Labels

**⭐ Recommended: Use the Consistent Interface**

The gem provides methods that handle FedEx's inconsistent label formats (URL or base64) automatically:

```ruby
shipment = client.create_shipment(params)

# Save label to file (handles both formats automatically)
shipment.save_label('label.pdf')

# Get label as binary data
label_binary = shipment.label_content
File.write('label.pdf', label_binary, mode: 'wb')

# For multi-package shipments
shipment.save_labels('./labels')  # Saves as label_1.pdf, label_2.pdf, etc.

# Or get all contents
shipment.label_contents.each_with_index do |content, i|
  File.write("label_#{i + 1}.pdf", content, mode: 'wb')
end
```

**Consistent Interface Methods** (Recommended):
- `label_content` - Get label as binary string (handles URL or base64)
- `label_contents` - Get all labels as array of binary strings (MPS)
- `save_label(path)` - Save label to file (handles URL or base64)
- `save_labels(directory, prefix: 'label')` - Save all labels to directory (MPS)

**Low-Level Access Methods** (If you need format-specific handling):
- `label_url` / `label_urls` - Get URL if available
- `label_encoded?` - Check if base64 encoded
- `label_data` / `label_data_all` - Get raw base64 string
- `label` / `labels` - Get full label object(s)

**Why a consistent interface?** FedEx API behavior is unpredictable:
- Same request can return different formats at different times
- Multi-package shipments often return base64
- Single-package can be either URL or base64
- Sandbox and production both exhibit this behavior

The consistent interface handles all cases automatically, so you don't need to check formats.

### Error Handling

All API methods return a resource object with status information:

```ruby
shipment = client.create_shipment(params)

if shipment.success?
  # Process successful response
  puts shipment.tracking_number
else
  # Handle errors
  puts "Status: #{shipment.status}"
  
  if shipment.has_errors?
    shipment.errors.each do |error|
      puts "Error: #{error['message']}"
    end
  end
  
  if shipment.has_alerts?
    shipment.alerts.each do |alert|
      puts "Alert: #{alert['message']}"
    end
  end
end
```

## Development

FedEx API configs are stored in `.env` file. Create one with `cp .env.sample .env`. That's enough for running tests since requests are already recorded with VCR, but you will have to update this file with real credentials in case you need to create or update VCR cassettes. Be careful to not commit real credentials. It's also important to remove credentials from VCR cassettes before committing it.

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).

### Docker

You can you docker compose for development:

 - `docker compose up`
 - `docker compose run gem bundle exec rake test`
